# graphics
This repository contains graphics libraries for use in game development

This Library Is VERY annoying to set up - but it can be done. To set up in a visual studio environment that
allows you to compile and run code, these are the other libaries I downloaded and set up within visual studio:

glew-2.1.0-win32 - Can be found at https://glew.sourceforge.net/
glfw-3.4.bin.WIN64 - Can be found at https://www.glfw.org/download.html
SDL2-2.30.4 - Can be found at https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases (Install the VC version for visual studio)
GLAD - to get glad use https://glad.dav1d.de/ and generate the files. glad.c will need to be put into your source code.

**NOTE** I built with Windows x64 using gcc on Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition
